# /Now
This is a new page on my site, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now), who came up with the idea of a “Now Page”. It gives you a glimpse into my life beyond 9to5 :)

## What I'm up to right **NOW**:

* Preparing for [Professional Scrum Product Owner™ I](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-product-owner-i-certification).
* Reading [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) by Donald A. Norman.
